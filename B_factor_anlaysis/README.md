Code for B factor analysis of various proteins. The project beginning file will plot in 3D your protein structure after
after you change the path to your PDB file and will output a B-factor graph for each chain. The B_factor analysis file is a specific analyis
of plotted B-factors Based on the chains for the protein and multiple PDB files.

Note: the project_beginning.py has a bug that will not plot B-factors larger than 100 (will give you an error). This has been fixed in the RNA_b_factor_analysis.py
