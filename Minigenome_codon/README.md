All of the code I used to analyze the sequence for the minigenome codon sequences, including my own scoring systems based
on pyrimidine and purines in the sequence. Also a novel model using Kappa Index of Coincidence or Linguistic Complexity to analyze
the sequence. Furthermore, B-factor analysis of the N protein output into charts. I will make of a notebook of this soon for each
to make it easier to view.
